  <p>About this car</p>
  <p>The NSX was originally made to compete with brands such as Porsche and Ferrari and succeded in doing that. Honda decided that they could go even further with the NSX and made the 1992 Honda NSX Type-R. This new NSX was more performance oriented, it featured a more powerful engine, and a lighter body thanks to its all aluminum body. The Type-R has a 3 liter V6 engine that made 270 horsepower, and had a 5-speed manual transmission.  </p>
